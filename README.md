First ever project intentionally made without the use of backend, framework and database. 
Many things to add like indication that you are not logged in on some pages, all buttons to be interactive and fixing how the content is displayed on different screens.
All of the data(images and dates) are from the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc. Also the first page was done from the video but after that was changed to how I like it.
