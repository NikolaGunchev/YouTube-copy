# A copy of YouTube's main, video, and profile pages.
First-ever project, made without the use of a backend, framework, or database.
It was made to learn HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

There are several things to add, such as: 
- indicating when you are not logged in on certain pages
- making all buttons interactive
- and optimizing the content display across different screens.

All of the media is from the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc. Also, the first page was done from the video, but after that was changed to how I like it.
