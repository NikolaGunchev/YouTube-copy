# A copy of youtube main, video and profile pages.
First ever project intentionally made without the use of backend, framework, and database.

There are several things to add, such as: 
- indicating when you are not logged in on certain pages
- making all buttons interactive
- and optimizing the content display across different screens.

All of the media is from the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc. Also the first page was done from the video, but after that was changed to how I like it.
